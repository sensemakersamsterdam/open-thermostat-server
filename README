readSerialTemp
--------------

INTRO
=====
This is a small python script that reads the serial output of arduino over USB. Assuming OpenThermostaat 
v1.0 is connected to the arduino, the temperatures are read, converted to Celsius and stored in a mySQL 
database. This code needs the Arduino to run the software for the temperature sensor.


PREREQUISITES
=============
1) Python 2.6.x [https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/]

2) pyserial-2.6 [https://www.pyserial.sourceforge.net/]

3) MySQL-python-1.2.3 [https://www.pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.3]

4) setuptools, needed for MySQL-python [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/1.1.6]

5) configparser, needed for reading configuration files  [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/configparser/3.2.0r3] 
the code looks for a file named simple.ini in the current directory. The file has 2 sections; 
[device]
device file in *Nix, baud rate

[database]
location, port #, user & password, database name

6) last but not least, a running mysql daemon.



TESTING
=======

Tested on slackware 13.1. By default on slackware mysql, is owned and run by the user mysql. If you wish
to keep it that way, give mysql user a password and add /bin/bash as his shell.
